# Battleships-AI
We've done battleships before, but this time we're creating Artificial Intelligences to play for us

Team2: [3 AIs and a simulator to test and rank them](https://github.com/tomviner/battleships)

Other teams feel free to PR your code on to this repo (in a folder e.g. team1/ or with a link)
